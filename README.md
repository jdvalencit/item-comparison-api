# Item Comparison API

This project provides a lightweight backend API for managing product data, designed to support item comparison features. The API exposes endpoints to retrieve, create, update, and delete products.

For simplicity, all products are stored as JSON files, which keeps the data human-readable, version-friendly, and easily accessible without requiring a database.

## ðŸ“‚ Data Storage

The project uses a non-structured file-based storage approach rather than a traditional database. Product information is persisted as individual JSON files in the `./data` directory

This design choice was made because product data does not always share the same structure. Different products may include different fields or specifications. A non-structured format like JSON makes it easy to store and retrieve this flexible data without enforcing a rigid schema.

## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

Due to limited time, some features and refinements were not implemented in the current version but are important to keep in mind for future iterations:
- Centralized error handling â€“ create a dedicated error handler function to standardize responses and improve maintainability.
- Structured logging â€“ integrate a specialized logging library for better log formatting, levels, and traceability.
- Extended comparison features â€“ enhance the API to support richer product comparison logic (e.g., multi-criteria filters, side-by-side output).
- Validation improvements â€“ add stricter input validation rules and reusable validators.
- Authentication & Authorization â€“ implement proper access controls (e.g., JWT) to ensure only authorized sellers can manage their products.
- Automated testing â€“ add unit tests and integration tests to ensure API reliability and prevent regressions.
- Database integration â€“ optionally migrate from JSON file storage to a database for scalability and performance.
- Pagination and Metadata - Add pagination support and include additional response metadata (e.g., total count and page size) instead of returning a raw JSON array of products.
- Universal Identifiers - Generate product IDs using a universally unique identifier (UUID) rather than relying on manually assigned IDs.
